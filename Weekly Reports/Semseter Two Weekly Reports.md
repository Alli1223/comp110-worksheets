# comp110-evaluation

##Semester Two:

###Week 1 

In the first week we were introduced to the new modules that we will be working on for this semester, the hardware hacking assignment looks like it will be fun as I quite like dealing with computer hardware.
We had a guest lecture from prof Simon Colton on computational creativity that I found really inspiring.

We also transitioned to C++ from python which is quite a bit different, but I feel confident that I can apply what I have learnt from python into C++.

To help further my study on C++ I rented a book on C++ by D.S. MALIK from the library.

I've also been working on Worksheet 4 and I've managed to get the Mandelbrot working first, however I did run into a few issues when trying to get it to work, so I used some online resources for guidance when I got a bit lost . Alothough I found the terminal hacking a lot easier to finish.

###Week 2
This week I received my makey makey kit and play dough and we started looking at prototyping and HCI for our controllers and why HCI is important. I also played all of the BA games they created last semester and chose one to design my controller for.

On Wednesday we had a lecture on how to use GitHub effectively in a team, which was very useful and I feel I now have a clear idea how to effectively use GitHub for the comp 150 group project.

We had our game pitches which I found very stressful as I'm not a good public speaker and I get very nervous. For the presentation I had my notes in a word document, and I feel that if I had made it into a power point, the presentation would of had a better flow, and I would of not missed as much stuff out.

###Week 3
In week 3 we had more lectures on SDL and C++ some of which I'm struggling to get my head around, especially getting my head around pointers and how to set things up in SDL.


To help overcome this problem I got a book on SDL game development that gives examples of how to set up SDL in visual studio and how to get started.

For my game controller I did some market research on existing game controllers and I'm going to try and make my controller with a minimalist design such as the wii nunchuck.

###Week 4
This week I tried to work on the A* search pathfinding algorithm, but I really struggled to try and find how to start, I tried to follow the pseudo code given to us but I'm still very unsure how to proceed.

One challenge I faced in week 4 was that the play dough for my controller dried and I was unable to re-shape it, so I think I may need to go the shops and buy some more play dough so I can re-design my controller for the next sprint.

###Week 5
For my controller I decided to move away from play dough, to a less conductive material, as the play dough was causing me a lot of issues by trying to separate the controller from the buttons. In the end I decided to move to cardboard for my controller.

Furthermore in week 5 my comp150 group worked on the first sprint of our game and managed to get a grid based system working.

###Week 6
I was ill for most of week 6 but I made it to the comp140 hardware submission on Monday where we had to demonstrate how our controllers work in class. 

As I was ill I went through the slides online and tried to research as much as possible.

###Week 7
Week 7 we covered IP and the laws that govern it, I found this very helpful as I didn't know much about it and I feel it is very important to know, although some of it was quite confusing and I found a lot of it was quite hard to digest.

This week I have been trying to catch up on the material I missed in the previous week. 


###E1
During the first week of the Easter holiday I started work on the coding task two for my group game project. I found this quite daunting, as I still feel quite unfamiliar with C++ and the whole object orientated design.

###E2

In the second week of the Easter holiday I worked a little more on the coding task two, and a little bit on the game project, however I still was trying to understand how the values can get passed between classes. To overcome this I started reading some general C++ support websites.

###E3

In the third week of the holidays I focused on the API project for the API-Hacking module. I found this quite easy as I have used unity before, and was quite familiar with how it generally works. I started by editing the rain script within the game, which only set the weather randomly. I started looking at which weather API would be the most appropriate to implement into the game. In the end I settled for openweathermap.org as this allows for free usage if you sign up. Further more I actually manage to get the API working within a day of programming, which I was quite happy about.

###Week 8

When returning we learned about git workflows such as gitflow, that makes use of branches to break up projects into smaller individual pieces. So for the game project, I created my own branch called Enviroment-AI in which I will continue to work on my individual coding task II.

###Week 9

This week I worked more on coding task II and managed to get some functional code that can add and remove oxygen from a cell. However this still is very buggy, so I should work on this more next week and try and remove most of the bugs.

###Week 10

This week I worked a little bit on the group project, but mostly I woked on the Agile essay that is due soon, for the essay I am writing about what issues distributed teams encounter when using Agile, furthermore how can these issues be addressed. I have found quite a few academic sources that relate to the topic in hand, however If I want to get a higher grade, I need to find some extra sources that I will try and find next week.

###Week 11

I have been working on the comp150 Teamwork review, which addresses the issues we faced when working on the group project, and I feel like this feedback will help a lot for future group projects.

###Week 12

This week I have been working on the coding task II and the group game project. In the last week our team has managed to finish off the game to a playable state, with a goal. I managed to get my coding task II implemented into the game so that users can click on a room to increase the oxygen level. However this crunch time was quite stressfull, and I now know to try and avoid it in future projects.

###Week 13
This week we had project demonstrations of the group game project and presented our posters for the coding task II which I found quite challenging as I do not enjoy standing in front of people and presenting my work, so I feel this is something I'll have to work on next year and over the summer.

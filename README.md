##Week 2
Content here
This week I worked on the SpaceChem assignment for Comp110, I enjoyed playing the game and found some of the levels fairly challenging. I spent a lot of time working on the wrong type of levels though.
I dowloaded LaTeX on my home computer and started playing with the features and getting a feel for the software. I really like using the software as it makes referencing and general formatting a lot easier and more professional than in programs such as word.

##Week 3
I spent week 3 doing a bit of research for the comp 130 essay, looking at library resources, as well as getting general knowlege about the console i was going to work on from general online sources.
I also started writing notes about the sega master system for the group presentation.
We started learning about python and JES, which i seem to be getting the hang of okay.


##Week 4
We put together all of our notes for the group presentation, which Samantha presented to the class.
We also went through in more detail about writing academic essays, which is all stuff i kinda knew about, but it was nice to be refereshed on.
Manipulating pictures using loops was enjoyable, a lot of the code i didnt completely understand though.


##Week 5
Learnt about Agile development
I noted a lot of room for improvement in my essay doing the peer reviews, found it very helpful to get that feedback before the essay submission.
I got the hand of the Removing red-eye tasks, i thought that was fairly easy to get to grips with.

##Reading Week
Met up with Thomas Sun,Mon,Tues,Wed for a few hours to work on the Flowcharts and Pseudo code.
Then met up on Wed, Thu and Fri to start working on the pair programming tasks.. found we spent a bit too much time on the flow charts and pseudo code when we should have been working on the pair programming assignment.

##Week 7
Spent the beginning of week 7 reviewing others code for the tinkering graphics project and improving my own code from peer feedback. Then spent the friday and weekend looking for research about the procedural generation articles for the architecture essay.

##Week 8
Trello
Learning SQL
For the creative design task, I decided to make a game of asteroids with the theme of Ice and Creepy.

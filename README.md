# comp110-worksheets
A template for the COMP110 worksheets and the weekly reflective reports.

##Week 2
Content here
This week I worked on the SpaceChem assignment for Comp110, I enjoyed playing the game and found some of the levels fairly challenging. I spent a lot of time working on the wrong type of levels though.
I dowloaded LaTeX on my home computer and started playing with the features and getting a feel for the software. I really like using the software as it makes referencing and general formatting a lot easier and more professional than in programs such as word.

##Week 3
I spent week 3 doing a bit of research for the comp 130 essay, looking at library resources, as well as getting general knowlege about the console i was going to work on from general online sources.
I also started writing notes about the sega master system for the group presentation.
We started learning about python with JES, and i think i uderstood most of what was being said in the lectures, but I think i just need to play around with it a bit more to fully understand.


##Week 4
Presented the group presentation
Went through in more detail about writing academic essays, most of which I kinda knew already, but it was helpful to have a referesher! 
We sent into more detail about Python and manipulating pictures using loops, classes etc.. 

##Week 5
Learnt about Agile development and scrums 
Peer reviews of essays was very helpful, it gave me a clear idea of what needs improving and what I need to do to improve it.
Removing red-eye tasks

##Week R
Spent a bit of reading week focusing on my essay, and making changes from the peer review.
I also worked on my tinkering graphics project, trying to get the zoom function working as i've been running into a lot of problems with that function.

##Week 6
Handed in Comp130 essay, although I had a tutor meeting at 11:30 and the essay was due at 12, and my tutor said some things were wrong with my bibliography but unfortuantly I did not have time to edit it.
After that I continued to work on my tinkering graphics project.
Guest lecture from Ian Livingstone was awesome.

##Week 7
Started looking into the kivy framework, and played around with the pong tutorial, and just generaly trying to understand how OOP works.
Also started looking for COMP110 references, this did not take me that long, as the scholarly databases contained a suprising ammount of content on PCG in platformers.
I also managed to find the full text for all my papers with ease.

Started planning COMP130 Kivy app based on the creative cards that were given to us. Mine were Ice and Creepy, and I decided to make the game asteroids as that is one of my favourite arcade games.
I created a very basic plan on Trello of what needed to be done, but as I don't completely understand Kivy yet, the trello board may contain cards that are not relevant.

##Week 8
We got set the Tinkering Audio assignement which seemed pretty interesting, and I started playing around with modifying sounds using JES.
I managed to get the first two audio algorithms done just pretty quickly.
Got feedback for the COMP130 essay, and as I already knew, I needed to improve my references and writing structure for the next COMP110 essay.
I still need to do more work for my tinkering graphics project to try and get it mostly done for before we breakup for christmas.

##Week 9
Made a litle bit more progress on the tinkering audio project.
Started on the COMP110 essay about procedural content generation for a 2d platformer, and chose 3 of the 5 PCG references to base my essay on, and then started writing the start of the essay.
I also made a little more progress on the COMP130 kivy app, working on the server side is going quite well as i've already had a bit of experiane with SSH and linux terminals.

##Week 10
Continued working in pycharm to make the kivy app, it's taking a while to understand how OOP works, and how all the code links together, as well as the kivy languange, but that is easier to understand.
Created the database on the server and managed to get my kivy app to print content from the database to a label, which was very satisfying when i got it to work.

##Christmas Break Week 1
implementing a menu screen and a game screen. I also spent a while trying to get a ball moving around the screen, with no luck.

##Chrstmas Break Week 2
Worked on the tinkering audio, implementing the first 4 algorithms, but when i got to trying to parse a token into the audio, it took me far longer to try and implement.

##Christmas Break Week 3
Made more progress on the Kivy app, the youtube tutorials helped a lot, and manged to move a rectangle around the screen on touch press, although there were still a few bus that needed to be fixed.

##Chrsitmas Break Week 4
Finally implemented the parsing audio algorithm into the tinkering audio project, this took me a long time and quite a few iterations to get it working, there is still a few bugs with it though. All the other projects, such as the tinkeing graphics and the kivy app are coming along pretty well.

##Week 11
I did the code review as soon as we got back from holidays, it was refresing to see how much progress everyone else had made on the project, and helpful to see how other aproached the same problems.
I realsed that some of the images used in my tinkering graphics project may be copyrighted, so i'll have to go through them, and switch the images out for other non-copyrighted images at somepoint soon.

This week I worked on the SpaceChem assignment for Comp110, I enjoyed playing the game and found some of the levels fairly challenging. I spent a lot of time working on the wrong type of levels though.
I dowloaded LaTeX on my home computer and started playing with the features and getting a feel for the software. I really like using the software as it makes referencing and general formatting a lot easier and more professional than in programs such as word.

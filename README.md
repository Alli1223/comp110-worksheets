##Week 2
Content here
This week I worked on the SpaceChem assignment for Comp110, I enjoyed playing the game and found some of the levels fairly challenging. I spent a lot of time working on the wrong type of levels though.
I dowloaded LaTeX on my home computer and started playing with the features and getting a feel for the software. I really like using the software as it makes referencing and general formatting a lot easier and more professional than in programs such as word.

##Week 3
I spent week 3 doing a bit of research for the comp 130 essay, looking at library resources, as well as getting general knowlege about the console i was going to work on from general online sources.
I also started writing notes about the sega master system for the group presentation.
We started learning about python and JES, which i seem to be getting the hang of okay.


##Week 4
put together all of our notes for the group presentation
Went through in more detail about writing academic essays
Manipulating pictures using loops was enjoyable, a lot of the code i didnt completely understand though.


##Week 5
Learnt about Agile development
I noted a lot of room for improvement in my essay doing the peer reviews, found it very helpful.
I got the hand of the Removing red-eye tasks, i thought that wasnt too hard.

##Reading Week
Met up with Thomas Sun,Mon,Tues,Wed for a few hours to work on the Flowcharts and Pseudo code.
Then met up on Wed, Thu and Fri to start working on the pair programming tasks.. found we spent a bit too much time on the flow charts and pseudo code when we should have been working on the pair programming assignment.

  END DO
Display image

Initialise soruceX value
Initalise soruceY value
    DO WHILE targetX is less than resolution of the pixels to copy
      Get pxiels starting at SourceX and SourceY
         DO WHILE targetY is less than resolution of the pixels to copy
           Set colour of pixels from targetX and targetY to the value of sourceX and sourceY
